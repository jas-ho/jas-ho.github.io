## TLDR

I implemented a simple web app version of the FVP ("final version perfected") task selection algorithm in half an hour by prompting Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
This was mostly to better understand Claude's capabilities.
But I also have used FVP in the past to good effect, so was motivated to have a digital tool for it.

## Step 1: Prompting Claude

I gave it an EA forum [post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dGmqqqf5kAyqQC3bS/final-version-perfected-an-underused-execution-algorithm) on the FVP algorithm as context. Next, I had some back and forth around the right approach to take for an MVP (CLI, web app, etc.) and settled on a single-page web app.

Here is Claude's summary of the UX considerations and requirements we landed on:

```markdown
# FVP Task Manager: UX Considerations and Requirements

## Core Functionality
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks for prioritization
- Complete tasks
- Reopen completed tasks

## Task List Display
- Clear visual distinction between marked, unmarked, and completed tasks
- Highlight the last marked task (next to be worked on)
- Show focused task with visual indicator

## User Interactions
### Keyboard Navigation
- Arrow keys (↑↓) to navigate through tasks
- 'M' key to mark/unmark tasks
- 'C' key to complete/reopen tasks
- 'N' key to focus on new task input
- Enter key to add new task

### Mouse Interactions
- Click on task to focus
- Buttons for marking and completing each task

## Visual Feedback
- Bold text for marked tasks
- Strikethrough and gray color for completed tasks
- Larger size and border for the last marked task
- Highlight (background color and outline) for the focused task

## Layout
- Task list occupies main area of the interface
- New task input form fixed at the bottom of the screen
- Each task displays text and action buttons inline

## Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support for all actions
- Focus management for both keyboard and mouse interactions
- Clear visual distinctions between task states

## Persistence
- Maintain task list state between sessions (to be implemented)

## Responsiveness
- Adapt layout for various screen sizes (desktop and mobile)
```

## Step 2: Refining in cursor

Claude's code was a great starting point, but there were several bugs and missing features.
I added these in collaboration with Cursor.
This took several hours.
My impression is that, as an application becomes more complex, it becomes harder to manage the codebase just using natural language prompting.
For example, I needed to intermittently reduce complexity (e.g. by prompting "aren't variables X and Y redundant?") or increase clarity (e.g. by prompting "let's add units to some variable name so it's easier to understand") for the LLM output to remain correct.

## Issues I ran into

- how can I get cursor to just generate diffs instead of regenerating the whole file? should I put instructions in the system prompt somewhere?
- when should I use which model for generation inside cursor?

## Disclaimer

The following is what Cursor has to say about the limitations of the current implementation :)
This implementation of the FVP Task Manager is a minimal viable product (MVP) and has some limitations:

- **Storage Limits**: LocalStorage is used for persistence, which has a storage limit of around 5MB. Large task lists may exceed this limit.
- **Synchronization**: Changes made in one browser tab may not immediately reflect in another tab. The app uses the `storage` event to sync, but there could be delays or race conditions.
- **Performance**: LocalStorage operations are synchronous and may impact performance with large datasets.
- **Security**: Data stored in LocalStorage is accessible to any JavaScript running on the same domain. Avoid storing sensitive information.
- **Data Loss**: Users can clear their browser data, which will remove all tasks. There is no built-in backup or export functionality.
- **Browser Compatibility**: While widely supported, some older or privacy-focused browsers may have LocalStorage disabled or limited.

Use this tool with these considerations in mind, and feel free to contribute improvements or report issues.
